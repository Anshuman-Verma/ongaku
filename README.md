## Features
* Displays a background relevant to the playing content.
* Seekable custom audio player.

| Key | Function |  
|:--------------|:----------------:|
| p | toggle pause / play |
| n | play next track |
| r | replay current track |
| f | toggle fullscreen |

  
### Some Pointers
* The app uses various media sources from the internet hence there is no media uptime guarantee.
* In case the track doesn't play or the background doesn't show up just file an issue or send a PR with appropriate media link.


### Todo
* Improve custom player UI.
* Display list of tracks in sequence.
