## Features
* Displays a background relevant to the playing content.
* Seekable custom audio player.

| Key | Function |  
|:--------------|:----------------:|
| SPACE | toggle pause / play |
| N | play next track |
| R | replay current track |
| F | toggle fullscreen |
| L | play last played track / track on the end of the list |

  
### Some Pointers
* The app uses various media sources from the internet hence there is no media uptime guarantee.
* In case the track doesn't play or the background doesn't show up just file an issue or send a PR with appropriate media link.
